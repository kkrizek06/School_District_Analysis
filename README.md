**Overview of the school district analysis:** The purpose of this analysis is to analyze student performance data, along with school type, and spending. We created a program using Jupyter Notebook, to run through, organize, and calculate school and student data. 

**Results:**

**o	How is the district summary affected?**

I don’t see much of an effect on the district summary. The scores for Average Math, %passing math, %passing reading, and %overall passing decreased by a little amount. This can be due to rounding.

**o	How is the school summary affected?**

I see a discrepancy in the percentages. The work done in the modules produced percentages higher for Thomas High School. The numbers I got in the module are closer the numbers in the report that removes ninth graders.

**o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas         High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

The effect of replacing these scores significantly improved Thomas High School’s performance. Their overall passing percentage increased from 65% to 91%.

o	**How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**

    	Math and reading scores by grade

There is no effect on the other grades. Just no 9th scores.

  	Scores by school spending
  
I do not see a change in this data compared to what was created in the module.

  	Scores by school size
  
I do not see a change in this data compared to what was created in the module

  	Scores by school type
  
Again, I don’t see a change in the data however, this shows that there is a huge advantage when attending charter schools.

**Summary**: I did see a significant change in Thomas High School’s data; however, I didn’t see much of a change in other data. This leads me to believe that I may have a mistake in my coding.
